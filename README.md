# Hierarchical Twitter

Trying to find conflicts within social networks.

## Code

Different version until I find one that I'm confortable with.

### `lib_api.py`

Uses the `searchtweets` library implementation for Twitter's v2 API.
More simple, maybe you miss something and might not learn everything.


### `plain_api.py`

Uses the `requests` library, making requests and getting back JSON.
Better for learning, maybe more work.
